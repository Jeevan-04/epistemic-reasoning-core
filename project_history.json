    "url": "https://github.com/Jeevan-04/epistemic-reasoning-core",
    "abstract": "<p>Episteme (formerly EDRA) is a persistent <strong>epistemic reasoning system</strong> with non-monotonic logic, explicit conflict detection, belief revision, and quantitative belief lifecycle management layered on top of symbolic inference. Designed as a <strong>post-logical</strong> system, it asserts that truth is determined by structural entailment and defeasible rules, while numbers (confidence, decay) play a supporting role.</p><p>Refining the earlier EDRA prototype, Episteme introduces a modular Sanskrit-named architecture: <strong>Manas</strong> (stateless perception), <strong>Chitta</strong> (persistent graph memory), <strong>Buddhi</strong> (logic engine), and <strong>Ahankara</strong> (system controller). It solves the fundamental tension between symbolic rigidity and probabilistic drift by enforcing a strict layer hierarchy: <em>Logic constrains Probability.</em></p><p>Key capabilities include: (1) <strong>Lattice of Truth</strong> for conflict resolution (AXIOM > EXCEPTION > DEFAULT), (2) <strong>Nixon Diamond handling</strong> (explicit <code>CONFLICT</code> verdict), (3) <strong>Input Hardening</strong> (strict entity/predicate namespaces), and (4) <strong>Quantitative Lifecycle</strong> where beliefs reinforce with evidence but fade via temporal decay unless logically anchored.</p>",
    "technical_philosophy": "<p>Episteme's philosophy is <strong>\"Logic First, Numbers Second.\"</strong> </p><p><strong>Post-Logical Architecture:</strong> Unlike neuro-symbolic hybrids that blend logic and probability into a \"soup\", Episteme keeps them distinct. Logic (Buddhi) determines <em>validity</em> and <em>possibility</em>. usage statistics (Chitta) determine <em>availability</em> and <em>confidence</em>. A logical contradiction is never overridden by high confidence.</p><p><strong>The Lattice of Truth:</strong> We reject flat belief spaces. Knowledge exists in a hierarchy: <code>AXIOM</code> (Immutable) > <code>OBSERVATION</code> (Empirical) > <code>EXCEPTION</code> (Specific Override) > <code>DEFAULT</code> (General Rule) > <code>HYPOTHESIS</code> (Speculative). Conflict resolution is a structural operation on this lattice, not a vote.</p><p><strong>System Hygiene:</strong> The transition from EDRA to Episteme marked a shift towards rigorous input sanitation and namespace separation. Entities cannot contain numeric tokens; predicates cannot leak into argument positions. This prevents the \"garbage-in, hallucination-out\" loop common in LLM-augmented systems.</p>",
